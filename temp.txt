The following poem is excerpted with permission from Lee Leitner's
"Viewpoint" column which is featured in a bimonthly periodical for Prime
INFORMATION users called INFOCUS magazine. The original authors were Fred
Bremmer and Steve Kroese of Calvin College & Seminary of Grand Rapids, MI.

FYI - a "wahka" is the decidedly "proper" (by popular vote) name for the
characters ">" and "<." This is in spite of INFOCUS readers of Denver
who still refer to them as "Norkies." The Michigan crowd apparently has
corrupted the spelling to "waka."

To wit, it is -

"...a poem we think is about the lowly wahka. Maybe. Well, perhaps--we're
really not sure what the poem actually is about.  Here it goes:"

Transliterated:

Waka waka bang splat tick tick hash,
Caret at back-tick dollar dollar dash,
Bang splat tick dollar under-score,
Percent splat waka waka number four,
Ampersand right-paren dot dot slash,
Vertical-bar curly-bracket tilde tilde CRASH.
